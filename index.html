There is just so much to see in Ubud! We leave tomorrow but I know that we haven’t seen half of it. We’ll have had 4 days in total here and I’d definitely come back. It’s pretty busy, there are heaps of motorbikes, markets, shops, restaurants, yoga places and spas everywhere. Regardless of how many times I walk down the same street I keep discovering at least 5 new shops I didn’t know existed. It’s definitely not the place to party though as most places close around 11 – the majority of the tourists are here for the yoga and rice paddies.

Accommodation

Nirwa’s Homestay – so good! The family are so lovely, they cook us breakfast every morning (giant banana pancakes which are green. Much nicer than they sound) and a fruit platter. The only thing to complain about is the giant hill to walk up to get to it and the lake that runs alongside the road could be a bit questionable in the dark/if you’re drunk. It’s up in the rice paddies whereas most other accommodation is in the centre but we don’t mind the walk (at least I don’t). Whenever we leave or come back the family are always checking we’re OK and asking if we need anything. Most of the tours and transport we booked through them as well which made everything a lot easier.

Mr Ketut’s cooking course

The cookery course we did was amazing! Mr Ketut’s pal was indeed there at 8am the next morning and drove us to Ubud market for a quick tour and tasting session. They fed us these weird green balls covered in coconut which have palm sugar in the middle and loads of prawn cracker things and Rambutan (lychee fruit). The local market runs from 5-10am in time for the tourist market from 10-6pm, which explains why it’s really hard to find food anywhere other than restaurants or the K Marts. He then drove us past the rice paddies to his house where we got cracking with the cooking.

Mr Ketut is an absolute babe, watch out on some social media for a video of him because I literally can’t put into words how hilarious he is. We made about 4 main dishes – noodles/soup/curry with some chicken satay and different sauces, including Sambal (spicy sauce) which we put in everything. There were about 7 of us in the group but we had our own hobs and Mr Ketut and his pals made sure we were doing everything right! We even had a go barbecuing before we started the best bit – the feast. It cost us 300K each (£18) but his rate is usually 350K for 8am-1pm. Definitely worth it.

Monkeys!

That afternoon we headed to the Monkey Forest, which various people had warned me about because apparently the monkeys attack you regardless of whether or not you have food on you, but we gave it a go anyway. It’s a huge temple/forest area and there are literally monkeys EVERYWHERE. All was going well until I was concentrating on getting a good picture of one particular monkey when his friend jumped on my head. They will steal anything you have on you, and we saw a few unzipping people’s bags to get food. My monkey tried very hard but thankfully my Fjall Raven Kanken has got some good zips so he didn’t get anything!

Walking back to our room from the Monkey Forest was a bit of a mission – about 30 minutes, so probably best to get a taxi or ojek (motorbike). That evening we went for dinner at Puspa’s Warung, a tiny organic healthy restaurant which was amazing. There’s only room for about 10 people to sit and the kitchen is in their corner so you can watch them cooking. We both went for what has become one of our favourites, Nasi Campur (pronounced Champer) which is basically nasi (rice) and a handful of small accompanying dishes like tofu, chicken, vegetables, soybean and various sauces.

Yoga

The next day we headed up past our homestay to the rice paddies (in daylight this time) which were just so green! There were palm trees everywhere and lots of fun old ladies hanging out trying to sell us bananas. We walked for a couple of hours before going to an ‘Intro to Yoga’ class at The Yoga Barn.

Having never taken a yoga class before, and not being able to touch my toes, I really wasn’t sure how it would turn out. They provided all the mats/straps (yes straps)/cushions and blocks so we just had to wear something comfortable and bare feet. Thankfully a few of us in a class of 10 had never taken yoga before so the instructor took it pretty slowly and made sure she was explaining everything properly. I’ve never seen anyone so flexible/toned in my life, it was like she was doing real life slow motion – the amount of solid muscle that was going on in each movement vs. my shaking arms! The session was an hour and a half and went through the basic positions (and she had a right laugh watching us fall over), in total cost 130K (£8) but if you buy classes in blocks it can work out cheaper.

Mount Batur

That night we tackled Mount Batur! We were picked up at 2am, (after having zero sleep), and driven to the volcano which was about 45 minutes away. There were 6 of us in total in our group, including an 8 year old girl, which we thought was a good sign. Later on that morning mid-volcano, they tell us they live in the Alps and climb mountains all the time. Fab.

Breakfast number 1 was a banana pancake at 3am before we started the trek. Our guide gave us all torches as it was pitch black and loads of loose rocks everywhere, but the first bit wasn’t too challenging. We walked for just over 2 hours in the dark, the second hour being consistent steps up equivalent to 2 normal stairs (sorry thighs) and made it to the top at about 5.30 with sunrise being just after 6. We definitely weren’t alone in the trek, as heaps of tourists for some reason we’re all racing to the top so we had to keep a quick pace. Once we got to the top our babe of a guide Yama went to fetch us breakfast number 2. I was starving and thankfully had haggled down some old lady at the market for some tiny bananas and ended up buying 15, so I was sorted. Yama gave us banana sandwiches and a boiled egg, because why not?

We saw sunrise up behind Mt Agung and Rinjani and then started walking around the big crater at the top. We got about half an hour in to the crater/walk down before we all realised we were walking across a tiny path with a sheer drop either side. Someone in our group was terrified of heights so couldn’t continue (…why are you climbing a mountain…) so I went for a quick run to see the rest of the crater before starting a second descent down the opposite way to avoid the tiny paths. Apparently our way was much harder than the crater-way down and even the guide was saying he was tired at this point. Yama taught us lots of Indonesian and made sure he was holding Lauren’s hand for the whole trek in case she fell over (LOL). We were back home and ready for bed by about 11am.

Today we chilled, got a massage and went for food at a charity restaurant called Fair Future Foundation – Warung Bale. It’s run by all 17-22 year olds and TINY, and all profits go directly to the charity. The kitchen is basically the size of a cupboard and in the middle of the restaurant and the food = incredible. We went for the tuna and had no regrets!

Tomorrow morning we are getting the 7am ferry to Gili T – the party island. Laters!</p>
